🌦️ Weather Prediction System using Machine Learning
This project is a web-based Weather Prediction System that uses machine learning and real-time weather APIs to forecast daily weather conditions like Sunny, Cloudy, or Rainy. It provides users with hourly weather parameters and a predicted overall weather condition for a selected city and date.

🔍 Features
📍 Select city and date for prediction
⏱️ Hourly weather forecast (Temperature, Humidity, Wind Speed, Precipitation)
🔮 Weather condition prediction using trained ML model (Sunny, Cloudy, Rainy)
📊 Separate visual bar graphs for each weather parameter
🧠 Real-time prediction using an ensemble machine learning model
🌐 Built with Streamlit for an interactive web interface
